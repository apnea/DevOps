# DevOps Principles: The Three Ways

*William Edwards Demings*
[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Edwards_Deming)

PDCA  (plan–do–check–act or plan–do–check–adjust)

TQM (total quality management)

## The Three Ways

1. Systems Thinking
2. Amplifying feedback loops
3. A culture of continuous experimentation and learning

Developed by *Gene Kim* and *Mike Orzen*

### Systems Thinking

Emphasizes performance of entire system

Colaboration across functional lines

Focuses on IT-enabled **value streams**

### Systems Thinking Outcomes

**Stops passing defects** downstream

Does not allow local optimisation

Always seeking to increase flow

Profound understanding of the system

### Practical Challenges

 - protect capacilty
 - pressure on delivery trumps experimentation and learning
 - leaders who balance capactity with experimentation and learning are key
 - create a culture where it is safe to take risks

## DevOps Principles: The Seven Principles and Seven Wastes of Lean

Papendorf/dick

1. Eliminate waste - partially done work, extra features, revisiting decisions, handoffs, delays, task switching, defects
3. Build quality in
4. Create knowledge
5. Defer commitment - one way and two way decisions
6. Deliver fast
7. Respect people
8. Optimize whole


## DevOps Principles: Improvement Kata

From Toyota production system - continuous improvement

Improvement Kata steps:

1. Understand vision and direction for project/product
2. Analyze to understand current condition
3. Establish target condition
4. Plan > Do > Check > Act (PDCA) toward target


## DevOps Principles: A3 Problem Solving Framework

A3 refers to European paper size

A3 Problem Solving = structured steps

| A3 Steps | PDCA Cycle |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 1 Background | Plan |
| 2 Problem statement / current condition |   | 
| 3 Goal / Target condition |  |
| 4 Analysis |  |
| 5 Proposed countermeasures | Do |
| 6 Implementation Plan | Check |
| 7 Follow up actions | Act |

Note:

Step 2 is aligned with improvement kata language

Spend time on the plan phase - great planning leads to good outcomes

Countermeasures - effort vs. impact


## The Westrum Model for Improving Organizational Culture

Devops is all about culture

### Westrum model

Ron W researched human factors in org safety

1. Pathological - large amounts of fear and threat
2. Bureaucratic - rule-oriented
3. Generative - performance-oriented

Also: organizational culture predicts information flow

3 characteristics of good information:

- answers provided
- timeliness
- presented in such a way as to be effective
